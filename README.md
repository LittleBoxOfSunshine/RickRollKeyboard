# Rick-Roll Keyboard

A silly program I wrote in high school that rick rolls you if you type. When you start
typing, the song starts. When you stop, it stops.

There are little bits of timing related chunking to smooth out the audio for a "better"
audio experience.

It has a hardcoded dependency on `rekt.mp3 ` being in the working directory. If you want to try it for yourself, find your legitimate ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) copy of Rick Astley's classic and place it in the output directory of your compiled code.

The premise is system. It's a modified system level key logger, but instead of recording the keys it uses that signal to decide if a given time period is considered "active" for
audio purposes.

I'll leave my funny disclaimer in their for posterity. It was intended to scare kids, but for real don't put it on random computers. Computer crime laws in the US are atrocious and
if you upset the wrong people you can be imprisoned for harmless pranks.
